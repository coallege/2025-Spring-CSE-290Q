Today we went over some LEAN basics and it looks sooooo much better than Coq.
Also when I went into the room, Ant was in there too!

I'll definitely enroll in the class.

It seems that there might be some kind of project and that Kyle is going to
expect us to be doing some kind of practice on our own. Which is fine. LEAN
looks so great that I definitely want to learn more in a structured environment
and not on my own.
