open Lean Meta Elab Tactic

/-!
Collecting some of the tactic API
-/

-- Gets the goals from the tactic goal list that have not been assigned.
-- (Sometimes tactics incidentally assign goals that they aren't working on.)
#check getUnsolvedGoals
-- Gets the first unsolved goal, throwing an error if there are no goals.
#check getMainGoal
-- Like `getMainGoal`, but removes it from the goal list.
#check popMainGoal
-- Pushes new goals to the front/end of the goal list.
#check pushGoal
#check pushGoals
#check appendGoals

/-!
Exercise: make `my_swap`, which swaps the first two goals.
-/

elab "my_swap" : tactic => do
  let x := <-popMainGoal
  let y := <-popMainGoal
  pushGoal x
  pushGoal y

elab "my_swap2" : tactic => do
  let x::y::r<-getUnsolvedGoals
    |failure
  setGoals

-- Test
example {p q : Prop} (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q := by
  constructor
  my_swap
  exact hq
  exact hp

/-!
Exercise: make `defer`, which moves the first goal to the end.
-/

elab "defer" : tactic => do
  appendGoals [<-popMainGoal]

example : ∃ n : Nat, n = n ∧ n ≤ n + 1 := by
  refine ⟨?n, ?_, ?_⟩
  defer
  rfl
  apply Nat.le_add_right
  exact 37

Does all the checks needed to make sure it is safe to do the assignment.

-- Uses the metavariable's local context as the local context.
#check MVarId.withContext
-- Tactic functions to elaborate terms (as Syntax) into.
-- These make use of a local context, so be sure to use `withContext`.

Exercise: make `my_exact`.
