# CSE 290Q: Topics in Interactive Theorem Provers

This is a repository to organize materials for the Spring 2025 offering of CSE 290Q, which focuses on interactive theorem provers, with a strong focus on [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/).

How to get started:
1. https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html
2. Run `lake exe cache get` to download a pre-built Mathlib
3. In VS Code, open the `cse-290q-25sp` folder.

You may consider installing the [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) VS Code extension. I don't usually use it, but I enable it when doing live coding.

VS Code tip: on the "Lean Infoview" panel, click the "..." and select "Lock Group". This prevents this panel from being used when files are opened.
